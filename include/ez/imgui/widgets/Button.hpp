/*
	Basic button. Most commonly allows for clicking on it, to drive some behavior.
	Can have text, symbols, or even images on it.

	What would be cool is if the button were simply a frame, that could be clicked.
	Then the contents of the button could be truly anything. This would make it possible to create selectables
	without special custom widget class.
